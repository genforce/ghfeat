In this repository, we show that *well-trained GAN generators can be used as training supervision* to learn hierarchical and disentangled visual features. We call this feature as *Generative Hierarchical Feature (GH-Feat)*. Properly learned from a novel hierarchical encoder, *GH-Feat* is able to facilitate both discriminative and generative visual tasks, including face verification,  landmark detection,  layout prediction, transfer learning, style mixing, and image editing, *etc*. Some results are shown as follows.

## Discriminative Tasks
